This repository tracks proposed changes that are being reviewed and/or prepared for inclusion in ROR. Proposed changes are reviewed by community curators to determine if they are in scope. Approved changes are then prepared for inclusion in a future ROR release. New and/or updated ROR records follow the ROR metadata schema and metadata policies.
# ROR scope
The scope of ROR is the “affiliation use case” - proper description of relationships between contributors, contributions, research sponsors, publishers, and employers. We use “affiliation” to describe any formal relationship between a researcher and an organization associated with researchers, including but not limited to their employer, educator, funder, or scholarly society. We define “research organization” as any organization that conducts, produces, manages, or touches research.
# Criteria for inclusion in ROR
ROR is a registry of top-level research organization affiliations. To be included in the registry, an organization should be:
1. A **top-level entity**, meaning that it is:
- A standalone organization
- Sufficiently independent from other organizations it might be related to
- Not a subdivision within an organization
2. A **research organization**, meaning that it is involved in one or more of the following activities:
- Produces research
- Funds research
- Employs researchers
- Facilitates research
- Manages research
- Publishes research
- Educates researchers
3. Is or will be **used as an affiliation** in published research outputs
# Requesting changes to ROR
Changes can be proposed by anyone via a [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdJYaMTCwS7muuTa-B_CnAtCSkKzt19lkirAKG4u7umH9Nosg/viewform). 

# Community-based curation model
ROR is employing a community-based curation model to maintain the registry. 

Community-based curation means:
- Anyone can submit a request to add or update ROR
- Leveraging knowledge and expertise from across the community in a scalable way
- Promoting broad community ownership of open infrastructure
- Centralizing curation decisions through a community-based curation board to ensure consistency and integrity of metadata at scale across the entire registry
