# About ror-updates
This repository tracks proposed changes that are being reviewed and/or prepared for inclusion in ROR. Proposed changes are reviewed by community curators to determine if they are in scope. Approved changes are then prepared for inclusion in a future ROR release. New and/or updated ROR records follow the ROR metadata schema and metadata policies.
# ROR scope
The scope of ROR is the “affiliation use case” - proper description of relationships between contributors, contributions, research sponsors, publishers, and employers. We use “affiliation” to describe any formal relationship between a researcher and an organization associated with researchers, including but not limited to their employer, educator, funder, or scholarly society. We define “research organization” as any organization that conducts, produces, manages, or touches research.
# Criteria for inclusion in ROR

- Produces research
